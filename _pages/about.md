*Mauro Lazarovich (Ph.D., Harvard University)* is a scholar of twentieth- and twenty-first-century Latin American poetry, fiction, visual arts, and intellectual history, in Spanish and Portuguese, with a focus on migration, refugee studies, and human rights.

His current book project, _Citizens of Nowhere: Stateless and Refugee Literature in Latin America_, analyzes works by Latin American writers and artists concerning the refugees fleeing World War II. The project aims to understand how Latin American literature and art documented the implications of the war’s refugee crisis and intervened in the creation of the human rights agenda articulated by the United Nations during the postwar period. 

His scholarly writing has appeared or is forthcoming in Revista Hispánica Moderna and Historia Feminista de la Literatura Argentina (2020).
