Mauro Lazarovich (Ph.D., Harvard University) is a scholar of twentieth- and twenty-first-century Latin American poetry, fiction, visual arts, and intellectual history, in Spanish and Portuguese, with a focus on migration, refugee studies, and human rights.

My current book project, _Citizens of Nowhere: Stateless and Refugee Literature and Art in Latin America_, explores Latin American writers and artists who responded to the refugee crises of the 1930s and 1940s—including Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda, João Guimarães Rosa, Jorge Carrera Andrade, Victoria Ocampo, Alfonso Reyes, and Lasar Segall. It argues that these figures helped create a discursive framework for addressing the emergence of the modern refugee condition before it was codified in international law, and that they contributed to shaping the United Nations’ human rights agenda in the postwar period. 

His scholarly writing has appeared in _Revista Hispánica Moderna_ (2024), and is forthcoming in _PMLA_ (under final consideration) and _Argentine Literature as World Literature_ (co-written with Mariano Siskind).

He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Program for Latin American Studies (PLAS) at Princeton University.
